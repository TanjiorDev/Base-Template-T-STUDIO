-- The tablet's single NUI callback.
--
-- The shared React bundle is built with `device.rpcAction = 'rpc'`, so instead of POSTing each
-- action to a callback of its own name it wraps every one in { action, payload } and posts it
-- here. That envelope is what makes the tablet possible at all: sd-phone's UI reaches roughly 460
-- distinct callback names, plenty of them built at runtime by app modules, and a companion could
-- never register that set up front. A missing name would 404 into a JSON parse error rather than
-- a usable response.
--
-- One dispatcher, three outcomes, in this order:
--   denied  -> refused here, without troubling sd-phone
--   local   -> answered by this resource, because it is about THIS device
--   else    -> forwarded to sd-phone's own handler over client/bridge.lua
--
-- A forwarded action may also be WATCHED on its way past (rpc.watch). A watcher is an observer and
-- never an outcome: sd-phone still runs the action and still owns the answer.

---@type table sd-phone invoke transport (client.bridge): token-matched request/reply.

local handlers = nil

---Registers the device-local handler set. Called once from client/main.lua after open/close and
---the typing and flashlight state they read exist.
---
---The completeness check is the point of doing this through a bind rather than letting main.lua
---register handlers ad hoc: policy.LOCAL is the authoritative list of what must not be forwarded,
---and an entry there with no implementation here would fall through to sd-phone and drive the
---PHONE's hardware from the tablet's screen. Loud at boot beats subtle in play.

---Some device state is only ever settled between the page and sd-phone, never announced to Lua at
---all - which lens the Camera app is framing with is decided by an NUI callback and nothing else.
